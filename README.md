# hello-world
My first repository

Hi my name is Daniel Evana Ukene but I prefer being called Evana.

I started coding in Python a few months back but I stopped mainly because work took the bulk of my time. I plan on becoming a self taught data scientist which would probably be one of the thoughest paths I've chosen to take in my life, but I'm confident I'm going to follow it through.

That being said I'm going to be sharing a ton of codes here. Codes I barely know how to write properly, so please bare with me.

Adios
